#TODO BOARD:
	 1. operator overloading:(for 1D Tensor) 
		|--->equal(for assiging another tensor) X
		|--->addition-auto type X
		|--->addition(w/another tensor)
		|--->
		|--->
		|--->
		|--->
	 2. MAKE THE OVERLOAD WORK VICEVERSA.
	




# DONE:
	 1. Add validation while a new tensor is created making sure the dimensions are correct
		 |
		 |
		 |---> this should solve problems with dimension errors in transpose and dot

	 2. We can use typeid(var)==typeid(object) to check for obj-type
		 |
		 |--> this will help us to make a dynamic dot product function
				 |
				 |
				 |--->	a) 1D vs int
				 	b) 1D vs matrix --> check dimensions
					c) matrix vs matrix -->check dimenstions
